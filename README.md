# EEG Signal Band Sigma-Delta Modulator

## üìå Project Overview
This project presents a **3rd-order CIFF Sigma-Delta Modulator (Œ£ŒîM)** optimized for EEG signal acquisition. The design balances **high resolution, low power consumption, and stability**, integrating circuit-level non-linearity analysis early in the design phase to improve efficiency.

## üîç Key Features
- **Sigma-Delta Modulator with CIFF topology** (optimized for power and stability)
- **MATLAB/Simulink simulations** for system validation
- **Performance metrics**: SNR = 119.33 dB, DR = 119.9 dB
- **Future work**: Circuit-level implementation & OTA optimization
